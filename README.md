# Zero-inflated Count Models

Report and code for a project on the accuracy of zero-inflated count models.  Coauthored by Junhyung Park and myself.

There is a fair amount of exploring in the R code- it includes more than what was used in the paper.

Only the smaller dataset is analyzed in this code.
